# 8. Feedback \(50%\)

Giving feedback is a high art, we are interested in cultivating at Latera. Constructive, appreciative and above all direct, prompt feedback enables quantum leaps in personal, team and organisational development. Hearing and giving open, critical and compassionate feedback and facing otherwise challenging situations, is also synonymous with what we call "dancing with our dragons" in [Dragon Dreaming.](./) 

Below we have listed the principles of two processes, that help us with giving feedback.

## Principles of the method Radical Candor

**CARE PERSONALLY** – To share and communicate real interest and goodwill for the other is a pre-requisit to give feedback. Request for permission to give feedback. 

**CHALLENGE DIRCTLY** – ****Direct feedback on specific, eye-catching behaviors is always better than no feedback!

## Basics from Non-violent Communication 

**PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY** – When situations or people trigger certain feelings in you, it's a gift. It makes you aware of something you may be missing, because behind feelings lie your deeper needs.

**THE BEAUTY OF NEEDS** – To have needs is a beautiful human quality for which no one needs and should be ashamed! Therefore you may express them from your personal perspective. 

**THE OPEN REQUEST** – If we know our needs, we can ask others to help us fulfill them. The important thing is that others are free to decide whether they want to help or not.

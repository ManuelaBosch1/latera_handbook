A body is a definied entity that hold power to take decissions in a certain way. We will have the following bodies at Latera.

| Body | Decission power |
| :--- | :--- |
| Roles, held by one member | Decide autonomously via mandate or using [**advice process**](3.-instruments-which-democratic-means-do-we-use.md)\*\*\*\* |
| Operational circle or working group or team | Decide via [**consent process** ](3.-instruments-which-democratic-means-do-we-use.md)around tensions concerning their filed of operations, made [**asynchronous**](5.-place-where-do-we-come-together.md) |
| Governance circle or working group or team | Decide via [**consent process** ](3.-instruments-which-democratic-means-do-we-use.md)on tensions concerning governance, made [**asynchronous**](5.-place-where-do-we-come-together.md)  |

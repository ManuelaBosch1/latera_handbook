# 2. Structure \(5%\)

What hierarchy or structures represent how we’re organized?

Design und Entwicklung gleichwertig.!

1. **Squads**\(The basic unit of development\)

   1. **Autonomous units**, operating according e.g..Scrum, Lean Start-up principles
      1. Tool 1 operations
      2. Tool 1 development
      3. Tool 2 operations
      4. Tool 2 development
      5. Tool 2 consulting services
      6. Magazine print
      7. Magazine ePaper
      8. Community events
   2. **Squads**own long-term service/product **mission**
   3. Have own **awesome workspace**
   4. Sepnd 10% of time on **'hack-days'**
   5. No squad-leader but a **product-owner**, responsible for piorities, all product-owners collaborate around a common road-map
   6. Access to an **agile-coach**to help improve process, team **owns its self-management process**
   7. Each squad member can **influence**his/her **work**
   8. Direct contact to stakeholders, **can easy release**own stuff with minimal-sync
   9. Run quarterly surveys to help focus improvements, team knows where to go for **organizational support**

   ​

2. **Tribes** \(collection of squads in related areas\)

   1. Like an **incubator**for the related squads
   2. **Tribe-leader**is responsible for providing the best habitat
   3. Share physically same office with **commonareas**to **support collaboration,** are designed to be smaller than 100 people for supporting of**social relationships**
   4. **Regular informal gatherings** to show what we are working on

   ​

3. **Squad dependencies**

   1. **Principle**of minimizing dependencies, blocking cross tribes dependencies
   2. Regular surveys to **track dependencies**and on demand meetings
   3. Seperate development squats from operation squats, have **operations as a service** for development, informal **effective collaboration, less documentation**

   ​

4. **Chapters and Guilds**

   1. **Maintaineconomies of scale**despite autonomy through chapters and guilds
   2. **Chapter**= familiy of **people sharing**similar **skills**, general **competence area**, and are from same **tribe**, meeting regularly to exchang, **Chapter Lead**is **line manager**for it's chapters members with traditional responsibilities such as developing people, setting salaries.
   3. **Guild**= more organic and wide reaching **community of interest**that want to share, it cuts accross whole organization, e.g. tester guild, agile coach guild, it often includes all respective chapters, but is open, there is a **guild coordinator** 
   4. **Chapter lead**acts more like a professor and **product owner**more like an entrepreneur, that creates a**healthy tension**

   **​**

5. **System Owner and Chief Architect**
   1. **Integrity of the system** as a whole is maintained by a role called**System Owner** \(in critical systems a dev ops pair\)
   2. They are the 'go to' person for technical and architectual issues. They focus on quality, documentation, stability, scaleability, release process. 
   3. Typically a squad member or chapter lead, with about 10% of time dedicated to keep overview of the system.
   4. **Chief Architect,** a person who coordinates work on highlevel architectural issues that cut across multiple systems. Reviews developments, their feedback is just suggestions and inputs, final decission lies within the squat building it.

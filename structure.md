# Platform Coop Principles



## Four principles of Platform  co-opS \(PC\)

A cooperative is defined as an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. A platform is an online application or website used by individuals or groups to connect to one another or to organize services.  Platform cooperativism, the growing movement to cooperatize online businesses, builds on these values by establishing four key principles of its own:  


* Broad-based ownership, in which stakeholders and workers own, and therefore direct and control, the technological features, production processes, algorithms, data, job structures and all other aspects of their online platform;
* Democratic governance, in which all stakeholders and workers who own the platform collectively self-govern the entity through democratic means and a one-person, one-vote principle;
* Co-design of the platform, in which various users and marginalized persons are included in the design and creation of the platform ensuring that software is not pushed down onto users, but instead grows out of their needs, capacities, and aspirations; and
* A commitment to open source development, so that platform co-ops can build new structures of collective ownership and democratic governance internally, while lifting up other emerging cooperatives in disparate locations, who instead of having to reinvent the wheel alone, can apply the cooperative model locally through a commons of open source code.

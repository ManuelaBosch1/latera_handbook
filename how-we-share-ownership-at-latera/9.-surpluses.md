# 9. Surpluses \(50%\)

For [steward-owned companies](https://purpose-economy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Purpose_Booklet_EN_Digital.pdf), profits are a means to an end, not an end in and of themselves. All the profits generated by the company are either reinvested in the business, used to repay investors, shared with stakeholders, or donated to charity.

* Amont reinvested in the business is determined by laws \(RÃ¼cklagen\), the constitution of the legal entity, and the current strategy agreed by the members in the annual meetings.
* Amount used to repay investors is negotiated with respective investors and is aligend with the [steward-onwership](https://purpose-economy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Purpose_Booklet_EN_Digital.pdf) principles. 
* Amount shared with other stakeholders, ****or donated to charity organizations is also agreed by the members in the annual meetings.
* Since the company is organized around the [steward-onwership](https://purpose-economy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Purpose_Booklet_EN_Digital.pdf) principles, members do never have dividend rights. It is possible for members to become investors that do have dividend rights, though

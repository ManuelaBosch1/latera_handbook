# 6. Finance decisions \(20%\)

**Finanzen Arbeitskreis / Chapter**

this part needs more thinking

i wonder at one hand internally about maximum autonomy of each [Squad](https://latera.gitbook.io/handbook/~/edit/drafts/-LVd2hDDYaa43RNx6Mjx/how-we-work-democracy-at-latera#7-structure-what-units-do-exist-and-how-do-they-relate), and what this means for this question, also i wonder about e.g. each tribe, e.g. tool1, tool2, magazine, learning-units. are there subsidiaries or muttergesellschaften?

also about strategy partnerships, alliances, join-ventures, networks etc.

**Who has the possibility to influence financial decisions?**

In daily business the elected finance stewards and certain **Roles** within their defined domain.

Overall financial strategy is decided by all members in the annual general meeting.

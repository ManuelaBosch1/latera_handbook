## This handbook today

Currently, Latera is in an early start-up stage. We have various fast evolving concepts on the different fields of operations of the company, an experienced, visionary and enthusiastic founder supported by a team of different experts and contributors, and a first product that will go into prototype production phase soon. 

This handbook is part of the start-up development activities, since we imagine Latera as a vehicle, we want everyone in the organization being able, not only to drive it, but also to maintain it. We want to work collaboratively and share ownership, because we want to enable people to steer and develop it collectively, in a way that it serves the common purpose, the organization and themselves best. Therefor we are creating this handbook: a comprehensive, understandable and motivational manual on how our organization works.

This handbook is intendet to serve Latera founders, employees, partners and supporters in the following ways:

* **Organizational development** – be a tool and dicussion basis for our organizational design in the current start-up phase by collaboratively documenting current developments and agreements. 
* **Recruiting** – help those interested to join, to learn if they are a good fit to the organization. 
* **Community Building** – help to develop a sense of belonging for those already in or joining the organization.
* **Self-Organization** - Be a user-manual and repository of knowlege for day to day self-management, communication and governance

This document claims neither to be complete nor perfect, but rather a living working document, that helps Latera folks to think and work collaboratively, and to share our state of the art and ideas with others who are interested in how we do things. We encourage feedback and questions, please get in touch if you see something you want to learn more of or that could be improved.
